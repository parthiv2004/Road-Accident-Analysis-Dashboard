🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard Using Power BI 🚦

I'm excited to share my project: a comprehensive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard developed using Power BI. This project aims to enhance road safety by providing deep insights into accident patterns and contributing factors.

🔍 Project Highlights:

1. In-Depth Accident Analysis:

Analyzed accident data by location, time, weather conditions, and vehicle types. Identified high-risk areas and accident hotspots using heatmaps and geospatial analysis.

2. Interactive Visualizations:

Created dynamic and interactive visualizations, including scatter plots, line graphs, and tree maps. Implemented drill-down capabilities for detailed examination of specific accidents and trends.

3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Tracked critical KPIs such as accident frequency, severity, and casualty rates.

Monitored trends over time to identify improvement or deterioration in road safety.

4. Data Integration:

Integrated data from various sources, including police reports, traffic cameras, and weather databases. Ensured data accuracy and reliability through meticulous cleaning and validation processes.

5. Predictive Analytics:

Leveraged predictive modeling to forecast accident likelihood based on historical data. Utilized advanced DAX functions to perform complex calculations and scenario analysis.


💼 Skills and Technologies:

Power BI: Proficient in creating interactive dashboards and comprehensive reports.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Expertise in developing advanced formulas and calculations.

Data Visualization: Skilled in presenting data insights through intuitive visualizations.

Geospatial Analysis: Experience in mapping and analyzing location-based data.

Road Safety Analysis: Strong understanding of factors influencing road accidents and safety measures.



🌟 Impact:

Empowered stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to improve road safety. Provided actionable insights to authorities for targeted interventions and resource allocation. Contributed to reducing accident rates and enhancing public safety awareness.
